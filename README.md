# Hand-gesture-robotic-arm
A hand gesture robotic arm is a system that mimics human arm movements using sensors like flex sensors and accelerometers. It detects hand gestures and sends signals to a microcontroller, which controls servomotors to move the arm. This technology is used in healthcare, automation, and assistive robotics for intuitive control.
